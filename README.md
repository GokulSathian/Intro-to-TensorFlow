# TensorFlow Projects Showcase

This repository contains the projects that I completed during my course, "Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning" by Deeplearning.ai.

## Project List

1. **House Price Prediction with TensorFlow:**  
Training a NN to Predict House price depending upon the given number of rooms data.

2. **Image Classification of Fasion MNIST Dataset (using CNN) with TensorFlow:**  
Fashion MNIST, a data set containing items of clothing. Used CNN to train the NN to classify the input image into following labels
0 T-shirt/top 
1 Trouser
 2 Pullover
 3 Dress
 4 Coat
 5 Sandal
 6 Shirt 
7 Sneaker
 8 Bag
 9 Ankle boot

3. **Using Image Generator for classifying and Labeling the given image with TensorFlow:**
using the happy or sad dataset, which contains 80 images of emoji-like faces, 40 happy and 40 sad.

Created a convolutional neural network that trains to 99.9% accuracy on these images,  which cancels training upon hitting this training accuracy threshold.
